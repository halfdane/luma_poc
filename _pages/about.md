## Canned
To keep track of things, I'm using this site to write down whatever catches my eye: 
so that I can easily find the stuff I used to know (and a little bit to show it off as well :) 

## Nerd
I like experimenting, trying out new ideas and learning.
Not to be good, but to learn. It energizes me. 

## Navigate by sight
My projects find me by themselves - I'm often inspired by instructables, 
but friends and family love to put a bee in my bonnet as well.
Often I'm not entirely clear about what to do next, because I don't like to plan these projects far ahead - 
this is my private time, and I'll spend it as I please.

Maybe you find something you like - or maybe something that annoys you.
Feel free to reach out to me: I'm responding to everyone.

## Copyright
Everything you find here was created by myself, but of course I'm standing on the shoulders of giants.
I'm getting my inspiration from all kinds of sources, and while I'm trying to point them out, this isn't a doctoral thesis.

So please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you find an error,
or if you notice that I'm using something of yours without giving credit (or even pretend it's mine).

If something isn't marked as the creation of someone else however, I myself am the original creator and 
I'm reserving all rights.
